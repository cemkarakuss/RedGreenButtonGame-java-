# RedGreenButtonGame-java-
A mobile game I made with Java. I can say it’s my first game project. There are green and red buttons in this game. If you press the green button, your score increases by 1, if you press the red button, it decreases by 1. I used 3 pages as home page, game page and result page. Although there are shortcomings, I think it’s a nice application. :)
